Thanks to apidoc/swagger; we can check the schemas / try APIs out via the url following http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html 

In order to run the environment;
 - Make sure there is no application run on 8080 OR 5432 since docker composition is going to use aforementioned ports.
 - Once pulled the repo, via terminal; go to directory same as 'docker-compose.yml' file. Then please run the following command via terminal 'docker-compose up'
